# monodevelop-addin-packager

Tooling to assist the development of MonoDevelop addins.

Current features:
 - 'Package Addin' to pack a MonoDevelop Addin project into an .mpack.
 - 'Create Addin Web Index (.mrep)' to build web index .mrep files for the addin.
 - 'Clean Addin Packages' to delete all generated package files for the active project and configuration.

Keep up to date with the latest features by following me on Twitter, [@matthewrdev](https://twitter.com/matthewrdev)

Author Notes:
I rely on this tooling heavily throughout the development of my own addins. The direction of the project is driven by repetive workflows that could be automated and issues I encounter that could be easily fixed by a tool. 

Feedback is welcomed.
